# Resume Entry - Real-Time Voice Translation Application

**Real-Time Voice Translation Application - Project Leader** | April 2024 - Current

• Developed a real-time voice translation desktop application using Python, PyQt6, and OpenAI Whisper, enabling bidirectional in-game voice translation with automatic language detection across 15+ languages

• Optimized the translation pipeline by implementing local AI models (EasyNMT/PyTorch) and multi-method audio capture (WASAPI/VB-Audio Virtual Cable), achieving sub-second latency and enabling offline operation without API dependencies
