# Pricing Strategy & Revenue Optimization

## Current Pricing Strategy

### Launch Pricing (v1.0.0)
- **Launch Price**: $7.99 USD
- **Regular Price**: $12.00 USD (after launch period)
- **Strategy**: Anchoring + Limited-time discount + Value framing

### Psychological Pricing Tactics Implemented

1. **Anchoring**
   - Show "Regular Price: $12.00" crossed out
   - Display "Launch Price: $7.99" prominently
   - Creates perception of value and urgency

2. **Charm Pricing**
   - $7.99 instead of $8.00
   - Psychological effect: appears significantly lower

3. **Limited-Time Offer**
   - "Limited to first 100 customers"
   - Creates scarcity and urgency
   - Encourages immediate purchase

4. **Value Framing**
   - "Less than the cost of a CS:GO skin"
   - "One-time payment, lifetime license"
   - "Professional tool used by competitive players"

## Price Evolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch (Weeks 1-4)
- **Price**: $7.99
- **Goal**: Build momentum, gather reviews, establish social proof
- **Target**: 50-100 sales
- **Metrics to Track**: Conversion rate, sales volume, review count

### Phase 2: Post-Launch (After 50-100 sales)
- **Price**: $10.00 - $12.00
- **Goal**: Optimize revenue per unit
- **Rationale**: Social proof established, reviews justify higher price
- **Metrics to Track**: Revenue per unit, conversion rate at new price

### Phase 3: Optimization (Ongoing)
- **Price**: $10.00 - $15.00 (based on data)
- **Goal**: Maximize total revenue (price × units)
- **Method**: A/B test different price points
- **Metrics to Track**: Total revenue, conversion rate, customer feedback

## Revenue Optimization Framework

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Conversion Rate**
   - Target: 3-5% (good), 5-10% (excellent)
   - If <2%: Price too high or value unclear
   - Formula: (Purchases / Visitors) × 100

2. **Revenue per Visitor**
   - Formula: (Price × Conversion Rate) / 100
   - Example: $7.99 × 5% = $0.40 per visitor
   - Compare across price points

3. **Total Revenue**
   - Formula: Price × Units Sold
   - Goal: Maximize this number
   - May require lower price if conversion increases significantly

4. **Platform Performance**
   - Track conversion rates on itch.io vs Gumroad
   - May find one platform's audience pays more
   - Optimize pricing per platform if needed

### Decision Framework

```
If (Conversion Rate × Price) at $7.99 > (Conversion Rate × Price) at $12.00:
    → Lower price increases revenue (volume play)
Else:
    → Higher price increases revenue (premium play)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- $7.99 at 8% conversion = $0.64 per visitor
- $12.00 at 4% conversion = $0.48 per visitor
- **Result**: $7.99 generates more revenue per visitor

## A/B Testing Plan

### Test Structure
1. **Week 1-2**: Baseline at $7.99
2. **Week 3-4**: Test $10.00 (if conversion >5% at $7.99)
3. **Week 5+**: Optimize based on data

### What to Test
- Price points: $7.99, $10.00, $12.00, $15.00
- Value propositions: Different messaging
- Platform pricing: Different prices on itch.io vs Gumroad

### Success Criteria
- **Primary**: Total revenue (price × units)
- **Secondary**: Conversion rate, customer satisfaction
- **Tertiary**: Review quality, support ticket volume
