## Quick Comparison

| Feature | FREE Version | Standard Version |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Third-party software** | ❌ None | ✅ VB-Audio (free) |
| **Setup complexity** | ⭐ Easy | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| **Reliability** | ⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **Diagnostics** | ⭐⭐ Basic | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced |
| **Compatibility** | Windows 10/11 | All Windows |

## Installation

Both versions use the same dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main difference is:
- **FREE version**: Uses `sounddevice` with WASAPI (already included)
- **Standard version**: Can use VB-Audio Virtual Cable (optional but recommended)

---

## Troubleshooting

### FREE Version Issues:
1. If WASAPI loopback doesn't work, enable "Stereo Mix" in Windows
2. If still not working, try the Standard Version with VB-Audio Virtual Cable

### Standard Version Issues:
1. Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable (see `VB_AUDIO_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
2. Use "Check System Audio" button for diagnostics

---

## Recommendation

**For most users:** Start with the **FREE version**. If it doesn't work on your system, switch to the **Standard version** with VB-Audio Virtual Cable.

Both are completely free - the only difference is whether you need to install third-party software or not!
