- Revenue per Visitor
- Notes (promotions, changes, etc.)

### Weekly Review Process

1. **Collect Data**
   - Export data from itch.io and Gumroad
   - Record in spreadsheet
   - Calculate conversion rates

2. **Analyze Trends**
   - Compare week-over-week performance
   - Identify patterns (day of week, time of day)
   - Note any external factors (promotions, reviews, etc.)

3. **Make Decisions**
   - If conversion <2%: Consider price reduction or value clarification
   - If conversion >5%: Consider testing higher price
   - Track revenue per visitor to optimize pricing

## A/B Testing Framework

### Price Testing

**Method:**
1. Run price A for 2 weeks
2. Record conversion rate and revenue
3. Switch to price B for 2 weeks
4. Compare results
5. Choose winning price

**What to Test:**
- $7.99 vs $10.00 vs $12.00
- Different value propositions
- Different urgency messaging

**Success Metric:**
- Total revenue (price × units sold)
- Not just conversion rate or price alone

### Messaging Testing

**Test Variations:**
- "Launch Price" vs "Limited Time Offer"
- Different value propositions
- Social proof messaging
- Urgency vs scarcity messaging

## Conversion Rate Benchmarks

### Gaming Software/Utilities
- **Poor**: <1%
- **Average**: 1-3%
- **Good**: 3-5%
- **Excellent**: 5-10%
- **Outstanding**: >10%

### Your Targets
- **Launch Phase**: 5-8% (lower price, higher conversion expected)
- **Post-Launch**: 3-5% (higher price, lower conversion acceptable)
- **Optimized**: Maximize (price × conversion rate)

## Revenue Optimization Formula

```
Optimal Price = Where (Price × Conversion Rate) is maximized

Example:
- $7.99 at 8% conversion = $0.64 per visitor
- $10.00 at 5% conversion = $0.50 per visitor
- $12.00 at 3% conversion = $0.36 per visitor

Result: $7.99 generates highest revenue per visitor
```
