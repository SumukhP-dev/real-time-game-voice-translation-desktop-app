# Launch Strategy Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete launch strategy for maximizing revenue through optimized pricing and psychological tactics.

## Launch Pricing Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch (Weeks 1-4)

**Price**: $7.99 USD (Launch Special)
**Regular Price**: $12.00 USD (shown as anchor)

**Rationale:**
- Lower barrier to entry increases conversion rate
- More early adopters = more reviews = more social proof
- Can always raise price later (easier to go up than down)
- Expected 40%+ more units sold vs $10 price point

### Psychological Pricing Tactics

1. **Anchoring**
   - Display "~~Regular Price: $12.00~~" crossed out
   - Show "Launch Price: $7.99" prominently
   - Creates perception of getting a deal

2. **Charm Pricing**
   - $7.99 instead of $8.00
   - Psychological effect: appears significantly lower
   - Common in gaming industry

3. **Limited-Time Offer**
   - "Limited to first 100 customers"
   - Creates scarcity and urgency
   - Encourages immediate purchase decision

4. **Value Framing**
   - "Less than the cost of a CS:GO skin"
   - "One-time payment, lifetime license"
   - "Professional tool used by competitive players"
   - Helps justify purchase decision

## Marketing Messaging

### Headlines
- "Break the Language Barrier in CS:GO 2"
- "Real-time Voice Translation - Never Miss a Callout"
- "Launch Special: $7.99 (Regular $12.00)"

### Value Propositions
- One-time payment, no subscriptions
- Lifetime license included
- Professional quality with regular updates
- Less than the cost of a CS:GO skin
- Used by competitive players worldwide

### Urgency Messaging
- "Limited launch pricing"
- "First 100 customers get best price"
- "Price increases to $12.00 after launch period"
- "Get it now before the price goes up"
