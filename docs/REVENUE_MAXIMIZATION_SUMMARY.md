## Expected Revenue Impact

### Launch Phase ($7.99)
- **Expected Conversion**: 5-8% (vs 3-5% at $10)
- **Expected Sales**: 40%+ more units
- **Revenue Impact**: Higher total revenue despite lower price

### Post-Launch ($10-12)
- **Expected Conversion**: 3-5% (social proof established)
- **Expected Sales**: Lower volume but higher margin
- **Revenue Impact**: Optimized revenue per unit

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Conversion Rate**: Target 3-5% (good), 5-10% (excellent)
2. **Revenue per Visitor**: (Price × Conversion Rate) / 100
3. **Total Revenue**: Price × Units Sold (maximize this)
4. **Platform Performance**: itch.io vs Gumroad comparison

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)
- [ ] Review all updated materials
- [ ] Prepare launch announcement
- [ ] Set up analytics tracking
- [ ] Create promotional graphics (optional)

### Week 1-2 (Launch)
- [ ] Upload to platforms with $7.99 price
- [ ] Monitor conversion rates daily
- [ ] Track revenue per visitor
- [ ] Collect customer feedback

### Week 3-4 (Analysis)
- [ ] Analyze conversion data
- [ ] Compare performance vs targets
- [ ] Decide on price adjustment strategy
- [ ] Prepare for price increase (if applicable)

### Month 2+ (Optimization)
- [ ] Raise price to $10-12 after 50-100 sales
- [ ] Continue monitoring metrics
- [ ] A/B test different price points
- [ ] Optimize based on data

## Revenue Optimization Formula

```
Optimal Price = Where (Price × Conversion Rate) is maximized

Example:
- $7.99 at 8% conversion = $0.64 per visitor
- $10.00 at 5% conversion = $0.50 per visitor
- $12.00 at 3% conversion = $0.36 per visitor

Result: $7.99 generates highest revenue per visitor
```

## Decision Framework

**If conversion rate <2%:**
- Price may be too high
- Consider: Lower price, improve messaging, add demo

**If conversion rate >5%:**
- Price may be too low
- Consider: Test higher price point

**If conversion rate 3-5%:**
- Good balance
- Monitor and optimize based on total revenue

## Platform Fee Analysis

### itch.io
- Revenue share: ~10%
- Net at $7.99: ~$7.19 per sale
- Net at $12.00: ~$10.80 per sale

### Gumroad
- Revenue share: ~10% + 2.9% + $0.30
- Net at $7.99: ~$6.77 per sale
- Net at $12.00: ~$10.35 per sale

**Break-even**: Need 1.42x more sales at $7.99 to match $12.00 revenue
**If conversion increases >42% at lower price, it's more profitable**

## Success Criteria

### Week 1
- Sales: 20-30 units
- Conversion: 5-8%
- Reviews: 3-5 reviews

### Month 1
- Sales: 50-100 units
- Conversion: 4-6%
- Reviews: 10-15 reviews

### Overall Goal
- Maximize total revenue (price × units)
- Build social proof through reviews
- Establish market presence
- Optimize pricing based on data
